Welcome to Day 13 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re focusing on monitoring and observability, key components for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of your applications in Kubernetes.

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll understand:

- How Prometheus collects metrics and monitors your Kubernetes cluster.
- How Grafana visualizes and analyzes metrics.
- Practical steps to set up Prometheus and Grafana in your Kubernetes environment.

## Why Monitoring and Observability Matter

Monitoring and observability are essential to:

* Detect and resolve issues before they impact users.
* Gain insights into the performance and behavior of your applications.
* Ensure high availability and reliability.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts:

* **Monitoring**: Tracks metrics like CPU usage, memory, and request latencies.
* **Observability**: Provides deeper insights into system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces.

### What Is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool designed for reliability and scalability. It works by:

* Scraping metrics from applications and infrastructure.
* Storing time-series data in its database.
* Allowing queries with PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).

### What Is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization platform that:

* Integrates with Prometheus and other data sources.
* Provides customizable dashboards.
* Enables real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Hands-On: Setting Up Prometheus and Grafana

### Step 1: Install Prometheus and Grafana with Helm

1.	Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

2.	Install Prometheus and Grafana in your cluster:

```bash
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

3.	Verify the installation:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

### Step 2: Access the Prometheus Dashboard


1.	Port-forward the Prometheus server:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-kube-prom-prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090
```

2.	Open your browser and go to http://localhost:9090.

3.	Explore PromQL queries. Example:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

### Step 3: Access the Grafana Dashboard

1.	Port-forward the Grafana service:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring 3000:80
```

2.	Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

3.	Log in using the default credentials:

* **Username**: admin
* **Password**: Retrieve it with:

```bash
kubectl get secret prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 -d
```

### Step 4: Create Dashboards in Grafana
1.	Add Prometheus as a data source:

* Go to Configuration > Data Sources in Grafana.
* Select Prometheus and use the following URL:

```bash
http://prometheus-stack-kube-prom-prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090
```

2.	Import pre-built dashboards:

* Go to Dashboards > Import.
* Use a community-provided dashboard ID, such as [3119](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3119-kubernetes-cluster-monitoring-via-prometheus/) for Kubernetes cluster monitoring.

### Step 5: Monitor Your Cluster

1.	View metrics like:
* CPU and memory usage for nodes and Pods.
* Request latencies for your applications.
* Active Kubernetes events.

2.	Set up alerts in Grafana:
* Go to Alerting > Contact Points to configure notifications (e.g., Slack, email).
* Create alert rules for critical metrics, such as high CPU usage.

## Benefits of Using Prometheus and Grafana

* **Real-Time Insights**: Get instant feedback on system health.
* **Custom Dashboards**: Visualize the metrics that matter to you.
* **Actionable Alerts**: Stay ahead of issues with proactive notifications.
* **Scalability**: Monitor applications of any size.

## Activity for Today
1.	Set up Prometheus and Grafana in your Kubernetes cluster.
2.	Create and explore dashboards with your cluster metrics.
3.	Configure alerts for key metrics like CPU, memory, and request latencies.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that youâ€™ve mastered monitoring and observability, tomorrow weâ€™ll dive into security in Kubernetes, including tools like Falco and OPA for runtime protection and policy enforcement.
