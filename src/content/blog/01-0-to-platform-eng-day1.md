## What Is the CNCF?

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open-source organization that‚Äôs part of the Linux Foundation. Its mission? To promote cloud-native technologies that make applications scalable, resilient, and portable.

The CNCF is home to some of the most popular technologies in the world, including:

* **Kubernetes**: The backbone of modern container orchestration.
* **Prometheus**: A leading solution for monitoring and observability.
* **Envoy**: A powerful service proxy for microservices.

In short, the CNCF drives innovation in the cloud-native space, providing the building blocks for Platform Engineers to create amazing platforms.

What Is the CNCF Landscape?

The CNCF Landscape is like a map of cloud-native technologies, designed to help you navigate this vast ecosystem. It organizes hundreds of tools, projects, and companies into easy-to-understand categories.

You can check it out here: [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

## How Is It Organized?

The Landscape is divided into categories based on the purpose of the tools. Here are the most relevant ones for a Platform Engineer:

1. **Orchestration and Containers**
   
    **Examples**: Kubernetes, Docker
    
    These tools manage your applications' deployment, scaling, and operation.
	
2.	**Provisioning Infrastructure**
    
    **Examples**: Terraform, Pulumi
    
    Automate and define your infrastructure as code.
	
3.	**CI/CD**

**Examples**: ArgoCD, Tekton

Streamline software delivery pipelines.
	
4.	**Observability and Monitoring**

**Examples**: Prometheus, Grafana

Track, monitor, and troubleshoot your systems in real time.
	
5.	**Networking and Service Mesh**

**Examples**: Istio, Linkerd
Manage traffic between microservices efficiently.
	
6.	**Security and Governance**

**Examples**: Trivy, Open Policy Agent (OPA)

Ensure your platform is secure and compliant.

## Why Does the CNCF Landscape Matter?

As a Platform Engineer, you‚Äôll often need to select the right tools for the job. The CNCF Landscape:

* Saves you time by organizing tools based on their purpose.
* Keeps you informed about mature projects versus experimental ones (e.g., sandbox, incubating, or graduated projects).
* Gives you options: There‚Äôs no ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù tool in the cloud-native world, so it‚Äôs important to explore alternatives.

## How Does This Fit Into Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineers use the CNCF Landscape to build Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs). These platforms integrate tools from the Landscape to:

* Automate repetitive tasks.
* Provide developers with self-service capabilities.
* Reduce complexity while maintaining flexibility.

For example:

* Use Kubernetes for orchestrating your apps.
* Implement Prometheus to monitor their performance.
* Integrate ArgoCD to automate deployments.

The Landscape is like your toolbox‚Äîeverything you need is there; you just need to pick the right tools for your specific requirements.


## Activity for Today

Let‚Äôs put this into practice with a quick activity:
	
1. Visit the CNCF Landscape: [landscape.cncf.io](https://landscape.cncf.io/).
2. Explore the following categories:
  * Orchestration and Containers
  * CI/CD
  * Observability and Monitoring
3. Choose one tool from each category and answer these questions:
  * What problem does this tool solve?
  * How might you use it in a platform?



**Bonus: Share your findings on social media using the hashtag #ZeroToPlatformEngineer!**

## Conclusion

The CNCF and its Landscape are your ultimate guide to the cloud-native ecosystem. As a Platform Engineer, understanding how these tools fit together is the first step toward building platforms that developers love.

Tomorrow, we‚Äôll dive deeper into containers and Docker, the foundation of modern cloud-native technologies. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and start building!
