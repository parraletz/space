Welcome to Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days! If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re probably curious about what Platform Engineers do or how to dive into the cloud native world without feeling overwhelmed. Donâ€™t worryâ€”youâ€™ve come to the right place!

In the next 30 days, weâ€™ll go on an adventure where weâ€™ll learn how to build super cool Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that make developersâ€™ lives easier, reduce stress, and help companies ship faster. And yes, weâ€™re going to have fun while doing it. ðŸš€

## Whatâ€™s Platform Engineering Anyway?

Letâ€™s get this straight: Platform Engineering is about making life easier for developers. The goal? Build toolchains and workflows that automate the boring stuff, eliminate bottlenecks, and help teams move faster.

At the heart of this discipline is the Internal Developer Platform (IDP), which integrates tools and technologies to simplify everything developers need to build, test, and deploy software. Think of it as their backstage pass to productivity.

## Why Platform Engineering Matters

Big tech companies like Google, Netflix, and Airbnb started building platforms to streamline developer workflows back in the day. Now, itâ€™s a must-have for teams of all sizes. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s awesome:

* **Less Cognitive Load:** Developers focus on code, not infrastructure headaches.
* **Golden Paths:** Predefined workflows that get teams to production faster.
* **Productivity Boost**: Self-service tools = happier, more efficient developers.

Sound cool? Youâ€™re gonna love whatâ€™s coming next. ðŸ˜Ž

## What to Expect from This Series

Over the next 30 days, youâ€™ll:
* Master cloud-native tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and ArgoCD.
* Learn how to design platforms that scale with your team.
* Dive into topics like observability, CI/CD, and security.
* Build a complete Internal Developer Platform (IDP) in a final project.

Each day is bite-sized, fun, and practical:

* **Theory**: Quick breakdowns of key concepts.
* **Practice**: Hands-on exercises to test your skills.
* **Resources**: Links to dig deeper if you want.

### Who Is This For?

This series is for:
* **Beginners**: No experience? No problem. Weâ€™ll start from scratch!
* **DevOps Pros**: Looking to specialize in Platform Engineering? This is for you.
* **Tech Enthusiasts**: Love learning new stuff? Join the ride!

## The CNCF Landscape â€“ Your New Best Friend

The CNCF Landscape is like a cheat sheet for cloud-native tools. It organizes everything into neat categories like:

* **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Manage containers like a pro.
* **CI/CD (ArgoCD)**: Automate all the things.
* **Observability (Prometheus & Grafana)**: Monitor your apps with style.
* **Security (Trivy):** Keep your platform locked down.

You can explore it here: CNCF Landscape.

Weâ€™ll use this map to choose the best tools for our platform. Trust me, itâ€™ll be fun!


## What Youâ€™ll Need

You donâ€™t need much to get started:

* A computer with Docker or Kubernetes installed.
* Access to a public cloud like AWS, GCP, or Azure (or Minikube for local setups).
* About 30â€“60 minutes a day.
* And most importantlyâ€¦ curiosity and a sense of adventure!

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™re kicking off with Day 1: Introduction to the CNCF and Its Landscape. Weâ€™ll explore how this ecosystem fits into your journey as a Platform Engineer.
