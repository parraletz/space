Welcome to Day 24 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re diving into autoscaling in Kubernetes, focusing on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to efficiently manage workloads.



## Why Autoscaling Matters in Kubernetes?

Autoscaling ensures that applications:

* Adapt to demand by increasing or decreasing resources dynamically.
* Improve cost efficiency by running only whatâ€™s needed.
* Maintain performance under varying loads.

### Two main types of autoscaling in Kubernetes:

- HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) â†’ Scales pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
- Cluster Autoscaler â†’ Adjusts the number of nodes dynamically based on pod scheduling needs.

##  Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

* Scales pods automatically based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
* Works well for applications with fluctuating workloads.
* Requires metrics-server to be installed.

### Step 1: Enable Metrics Server

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

###  Step 2: Deploy a Sample Application

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m`
          limits:
            cpu: "200m"
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 3: Create an HPA for the Deployment

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
```

### Step 4: Check HPA Status

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

ðŸ’¡ HPA will increase/decrease pods based on CPU usage automatically.


## Cluster Autoscaler

*  Scales nodes up/down when pods canâ€™t be scheduled due to resource constraints.
*  Works with cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

### Step 1: Deploy Cluster Autoscaler on AWS EKS

```bash
helm repo add autoscaler https://kubernetes.github.io/autoscaler
helm repo update
helm install cluster-autoscaler autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set autoDiscovery.clusterName=my-cluster \
  --set awsRegion=us-west-2
```

### Step 2: Verify Cluster Autoscaler

```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```

ðŸ’¡ Cluster Autoscaler ensures that Kubernetes adds/removes nodes as needed.

##  Activity for Today

1. Deploy HPA for a sample application.
2. Enable Cluster Autoscaler and scale up/down nodes.
3. Test autoscaling by generating load on your application.
