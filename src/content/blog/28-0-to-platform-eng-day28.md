Welcome to Day 22 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re diving into Backstage, the leading Internal Developer Platform (IDP) tool, to build service templates and a software catalog for streamlined developer workflows.



## Why Use Backstage for Service Templates and Catalogs?

Backstage, originally developed by Spotify, helps platform teams:

*  Standardize service creation with templates.
*  Provide a single source of truth for all microservices.
*  Improve developer self-service capabilities.
*  Reduce onboarding time by automating infrastructure setup.

ðŸ“Œ Companies like Spotify, American Airlines, and Expedia use Backstage to improve DevEx.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of Backstage:

* Software Catalog â†’ Organizes services, APIs, and dependencies.
* Service Templates â†’ Automates project scaffolding and best practices.
* Plugins & Extensibility â†’ Integrates with Kubernetes, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, etc.

ðŸ’¡ Backstage simplifies service discovery and deployment for engineering teams!

## Hands-On: Setting Up Backstage

### Step 1: Install Backstage Locally

1. Install Node.js and Yarn:
   
```bash
npm install -g yarn
````

2. Create a new Backstage app:

```bash
npx @backstage/create-app@latest
cd my-backstage-app
```

3. Start Backstage:

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open Backstage in your browser: http://localhost:3000

## Step 2: Adding Services to the Software Catalog

1. Navigate to Create Component in Backstage.
2. Register an existing GitHub repository.
3. Define catalog-info.yaml in the repo:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: zero-to-platform
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: parraletz/zero-to-platform-engineer
spec:
  type: service
  owner: engineering
  lifecycle: production
```

4. Push changes and Backstage will automatically detect the service.

## Step 3: Creating a Service Template

Service templates allow teams to quickly scaffold new projects with best practices.

1. Create a `template.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: nodejs-service
  title: Node.js Service Template
  description: Scaffolds a Node.js microservice
spec:
  owner: platform-team
  type: service
  steps:
    - action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton
        values:
          name: ${{ parameters.name }}
  output:
    serviceUrl: https://github.com/parraletz/${{ parameters.name }}
```

2. Define the skeleton project inside the `skeleton` directory:

```bash
mkdir skeleton
cd skeleton

# Create a package.json file
npm init -y
```

3.Add the template to Backstage.

ðŸ“Œ Now, developers can create standardized services in a few clicks!


## How Templates Improve Developer Experience (DevEx)

**Before Templates:

* Developers manually set up services.
* Different projects have inconsistent configurations.
* Onboarding a new developer takes days.

With Backstage Templates:

* Developers can spin up new services instantly.
* Enforces best practices across all projects.
* Onboarding takes minutes instead of day


##  Activity for Today

1. Set up Backstage locally and explore the UI.
2. Register a service in the Software Catalog.
3. Create a Service Template for a microservice.
