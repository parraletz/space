Welcome to Day 14 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™ll focus on securing Kubernetes clusters, covering runtime security and policy enforcement to ensure your applications and infrastructure are protected from vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.


## Why Kubernetes Security Matters?

Kubernetes security is critical to:

* Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and applications.
* Detect and respond to runtime threats.
* Ensure compliance with security and governance policies.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Security Concepts:

* **Runtime Security**: Detect and respond to suspicious behavior in running workloads.
* **Policy Enforcement**: Apply guardrails to prevent risky configurations.

### What Are Falco and OPA?

Falco

* Purpose: Runtime security monitoring.
* How It Works: Detects unexpected behavior (e.g., file changes, unauthorized process execution) in Kubernetes clusters.
* Key Features:
- Monitors workloads in real-time.
- Generates alerts for anomalous behavior.

Open Policy Agent (OPA):

* Purpose: Policy enforcement.
* How It Works: Uses policies written in Rego to evaluate requests and enforce rules in Kubernetes.
* Key Features:
- Applies guardrails for configurations (e.g., restricting resource requests/limits).
- Ensures compliance with security policies.

## Hands-On: Securing Kubernetes

### Step 1: Install Falco

1.	Add the Helm repository for Falco:

```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

2.		Install Falco in your cluster:

```bash
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --create-namespace
```

3 . Verify that Falco is installed:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n falco
```

4 . View Falco alerts:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=falco -n falco
```

### Step 2: Configure OPA for Policy Enforcement

1. Add the Gatekeeper Helm chart (OPA Kubernetes extension):

```bash
helm repo add gatekeeper https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts
helm repo update
```

2.	Install Gatekeeper in your cluster:

```bash 
helm install gatekeeper gatekeeper/gatekeeper --namespace gatekeeper-system --create-namespace
```

3. Create a sample policy to enforce resource limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: k8sresourcelimits
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: K8sResourceLimits
  targets:
  - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
    rego: |
      package k8sresourcelimits
      deny[msg] {
        input.review.object.spec.containers[_].resources.limits.cpu == ""
        msg := "CPU limits must be set"
      }
```

4 . Apply the policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f policy.yaml
```

5. Test the policy by deploying a Pod without CPU limits and observing the denial.

### Step 3: Monitor and Respond to Security Incidents

1.	Simulate a runtime security event (e.g., modifying a critical file inside a container) and observe Falco alerts.
2. Test policy enforcement with OPA by deploying a misconfigured resource and viewing the rejection.

##  Activity for Today

1.	Install Falco and configure runtime security monitoring.
2.	Set up OPA/Gatekeeper to enforce a policy for Kubernetes configurations.
3.	Simulate a runtime threat and test policy violations to observe how your security systems respond.


## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that youâ€™ve secured your Kubernetes clusters, tomorrow weâ€™ll explore automating Kubernetes workflows with tools like Kustomize and Skaffold.
