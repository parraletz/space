Welcome to Day 12 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re diving deeper into GitOps by exploring Argo Rollouts, a powerful tool for managing progressive delivery strategies like canary and blue-green deployments.

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll understand:

- What GitOps is and why itâ€™s transformative for managing Kubernetes.
- How to use ArgoCD to implement GitOps.
- Hands-on steps to set up and deploy applications with ArgoCD.

## What Are Argo Rollouts?

Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller that extends the functionality of Deployments by providing advanced deployment strategies such as:

- **Canary Deployments**: Gradually shift traffic to a new version while monitoring its behavior.
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Keep two versions (blue and green) and switch traffic seamlessly.
- **Progressive Delivery**: Safely deliver updates while minimizing risks.

### Why Use Argo Rollouts?

Argo Rollouts integrates seamlessly with GitOps workflows, making it a powerful choice for:

- Automated deployments with minimal downtime.
- Real-time traffic control and monitoring.
- Enhanced rollback capabilities.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Use Case: Argo Rollouts is ideal for applications requiring high availability, such as APIs or user-facing services.

## Hands-On: Setting Up Argo Rollouts

### Step 1: Install Argo Rollouts

1. Add the Argo Rollouts controller to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts
kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

2. Verify that Argo Rollouts is installed:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argo-rollouts
```

### Step 2: Create a Canary Deployment

1. Define a sample Rollout with a canary strategy:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: canary-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: canary-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: canary-example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.21
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 25
        - pause: { duration: 30s }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 30s }
        - setWeight: 100
```

2. Apply the Rollout:

```bash
kubectl apply -f canary-rollout.yaml
```

3. Monitor the progress of the Rollout:

```bash
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout canary-example --watch
```

### Step 3: Create a Blue-Green Deployment

1. Define a Rollout with a blue-green strategy:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: blue-green-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: blue-green-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: blue-green-example
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.21
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      activeService: active-svc
      previewService: preview-svc
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
```

2. Apply the Rollout:

```bash
kubectl apply -f blue-green-rollout.yaml
```

3. View the active and preview services:

```bash
kubectl get svc -l app=blue-green-example
```

Step 4: Rollbacks and Promotions

1. To promote a preview version in a blue-green strategy:

```bash
kubectl argo rollouts promote blue-green-example
```

2. To roll back a canary deployment:

```bash
kubectl argo rollouts rollback canary-example
```

Activity for Today

1. Set up Argo Rollouts in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Create and test a canary deployment.
3. Implement a blue-green deployment and practice rolling back and promoting versions.
