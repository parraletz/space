Welcome to Day 5 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! Yesterday, we explored Deployments and Scaling in Kubernetes, learning how to manage application lifecycles and scale them effectively. Today, weâ€™ll dive into Kubernetes Services, which are essential for enabling communication between your applications and making them accessible to users.

## What Are Kubernetes Services?

In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy for accessing them. Services allow applications to:

- Communicate with each other inside the cluster.
- Be exposed to external traffic for user access.

Without Services, Pods would be difficult to communicate with because their IP addresses change frequently as they are created or destroyed.

## Types of Kubernetes Services

There are four main types of Services, each with a specific purpose:

1. ClusterIP (Default)

- Exposes the Service inside the cluster.
-     Use case: Internal communication between applications.

2. NodePort

- Exposes the Service on a specific port of each Nodeâ€™s IP.
- Use case: Debugging or direct access during development.

3. LoadBalancer

- Integrates with cloud provider load balancers to expose the Service externally.
- Use case: Production-ready applications needing external access.

4. ExternalName

- Maps the Service to an external DNS name.
- Use case: Accessing external resources like APIs.

## How Services Fit Into Platform Engineering

As a Platform Engineer, Kubernetes Services are critical for:

- Enabling seamless communication between microservices.
- Managing traffic between internal and external systems.
- Simplifying application access with stable endpoints.

## Hands-On: Creating Kubernetes Services

### Step 1: Deploy a Simple Application

Letâ€™s deploy an example application to work with.

1. Create a file named nginx-deployment.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

2. Apply the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

3. Verify the Pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## Step 2: Create a ClusterIP Service

1. Create a file named nginx-service.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

2. Apply the Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

3. Verify the Service:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

4. Access the Service inside the cluster:

```bash
kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment -- curl http://nginx-service
```

ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s happening?
The Service provides a stable IP and DNS name (nginx-service) that can be used to communicate with the Pods.

## Step 3: Create a NodePort Service

1. Edit the nginx-service.yaml file and change the type to NodePort:

```yaml
type: NodePort
```

2. Apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

3. Get the NodePort:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

4. Access the application:

```bash
curl http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
```

ðŸŽ¯ Pro tip: Use minikube service nginx-service if youâ€™re running Minikube.

### Step 4: Expose the Service with a LoadBalancer (Optional)

If youâ€™re using a cloud provider, you can change the type to LoadBalancer:

```yaml
type: LoadBalancer
```

2. Apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

3. Verify the Service:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

## Activity for Today

- Deploy the example application and create a ClusterIP Service to connect the Pods.
- Change the Service to NodePort and access it from your browser.
- If using a cloud provider, try creating a LoadBalancer Service for external access.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

With Services, you now know how to connect your applications and expose them to users. Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore ConfigMaps and Secrets, which help manage configuration and sensitive data in Kubernetes.
