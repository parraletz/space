Welcome to Day 17 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re focusing on visualizing Kubernetes metrics with Grafana, creating real-time dashboards to monitor application performance.

## Why Use Grafana ?

Grafana is an open-source observability platform that helps you:

- Visualize metrics from Prometheus, Loki, and other data sources.
- Create dynamic dashboards for monitoring infrastructure and applications.
- Set up alerts to detect performance issues in real-time.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:

- Supports multiple data sources (Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.).
- Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Configurable alerts for proactive issue resolution.

## Hands-On: Setting Up Grafana for Kubernetes

### Step 1: Install Grafana with Helm

1. Add the Grafana Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

2. Install Grafana in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

3. Verify that Grafana is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

### Step 2: Access Grafana

1. Forward Grafana to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana -n monitoring 3000:80
```

2. Open Grafana in your browser:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:3000
```

3. Retrieve the admin password:

```bash
kubectl get secret grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 -d
```

4. Login:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `Retrieved from the previous command`.

### Step 3: Connect Prometheus as a Data Source

1. In the Grafana UI, go to Configuration > Data Sources.
2. Click Add data source and select Prometheus.
3. Enter the Prometheus URL:

```bash
http://prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090
```

4. Click Save & Test to confirm the connection.

### Step 4: Import a Pre-Built Kubernetes Dashboard

1. Go to Dashboards > Import.
2. Enter Dashboard ID: 3119 (Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring).
3. Select Prometheus as the data source.
4. Click Import to visualize your cluster metrics.

### Step 5: Create a Custom Dashboard

1. Go to Create > Dashboard.
2. Add a Graph Panel and use the following PromQL queries:

- CPU Usage:

```promql
sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) by (pod)
```

- Memory Usage:

```promql
sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (pod)
```

- Request Rates:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[1m])
```

3. Click **Save** to store your custom dashboard.

### Step 6: Set Up Alerts in Grafana

1. Navigate to Alerting > Contact Points and add Slack, Email, or PagerDuty.
2. Create a new Alert Rule:
   1. Condition: CPU usage > 85% for 2 minutes.
   2. Notification: Send to configured contact points.
3. Click Save to activate alerts.

## Activity for Today

1. Deploy Grafana and connect it to Prometheus.
2. Import a pre-built Kubernetes dashboard.
3. Create a custom dashboard with key performance metrics.
4. Set up alerts for proactive monitoring.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry, gaining deeper insights into request flows across microservices.
