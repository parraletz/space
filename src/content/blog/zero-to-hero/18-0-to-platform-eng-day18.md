Welcome to Day 18 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re diving into Distributed Tracing using OpenTelemetry, an essential tool for monitoring request flows across microservices.

## Why Use Distributed Tracing?

In a microservices architecture, tracing helps:

- Understand request flows across multiple services.
- Detect performance bottlenecks in applications.
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for better debugging.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:

- Provides end-to-end visibility across distributed systems.
- Helps pinpoint slow API calls and database queries.
- Standardizes tracing across multiple languages and frameworks.

## What Is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source observability framework that standardizes:

- Tracing: Capturing request flows.
- Metrics: Collecting application performance data.
- Logs: Providing detailed event tracking.

ðŸ’¡ OTel is supported by Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Datadog, AWS X-Ray, and more!

## Hands-On: Setting Up OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes

### Step 1: Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector

1. Add the OpenTelemetry Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
helm repo update
```

2. Install OpenTelemetry Collector:

```bash
helm install otel-collector open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

3. Verify the installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

### Step 2: Instrumenting a Microservice

1. Add OpenTelemetry SDK to your application. Example for Python:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

2. Modify your application to send traces:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://otel-collector:4317")))

trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("zero-eng-tracing"):
    print("Tracing request flow...")
```

3. Deploy your application and verify traces are being collected.

### Step 3: Visualizing Traces in Jaeger

1. Install Jaeger in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger --namespace monitoring
```

2. Forward Jaeger to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query -n monitoring 16686:16686
```

3. Open Jaeger UI:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:16686
```

4. Search for traces related to your application.

### Step 4: Integrating Traces with Grafana

1. Add OpenTelemetry as a data source in Grafana.
2. Import a pre-built tracing dashboard (ID: 14932).
3. View distributed traces alongside Prometheus metrics.

## Activity for Today

1. Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector in Kubernetes.
2. Instrument a microservice with OpenTelemetry.
3. Visualize distributed traces in Jaeger.
