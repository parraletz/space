Welcome to Day 15 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re diving into workflow automation for Kubernetes using Kustomize and Skaffold, two tools that simplify managing and deploying Kubernetes configurations

## Why Automate Kubernetes Workflows?

**Automation helps you:**

Simplify complex deployments.

- Increase development speed with streamlined workflows.
- Maintain consistent environments across teams.

**ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts:**

- **Kustomize**: Customize Kubernetes YAML configurations without modifying the original files.
- **Skaffold**: Automate the build, push, and deployment process for Kubernetes applications.

### What Is Kustomize?

Kustomize is a Kubernetes-native configuration tool that allows you to:

- Overlay changes to YAML manifests.
- Reuse and customize resources for different environments.

**ðŸŽ¯ Use Case**: Configure a single application for dev, staging, and production without duplicating YAML files.

### What Is Skaffold?

Skaffold is a command-line tool that automates Kubernetes workflows, including:

- Building container images.
- Pushing images to registries.
- Deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters.

**ðŸŽ¯ Use Case:** Speed up development by automating repetitive tasks.

## Hands-On: Automating Workflows with Kustomize and Skaffold

### Step 1: Set Up Kustomize

1. Create a base configuration `(base/deployment.yaml)`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.21
```

2. Create a development configuration `(overlays/dev/deployment.yaml)`:

```yaml
bases:
  - ../../base

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
```

3. Create a patch file `(overlays/dev/deployment-patch.yaml)`:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.21-alpine
```

4. Build the configuration for the dev environment:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
```

### Step 2: Automate with Skaffold

1. Install Skaffold:

```bash
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64
chmod +x skaffold
sudo mv skaffold /usr/local/bin

```

2. Create a `skaffold.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta26
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
    - image: app
deploy:
  kustomize:
    paths:
      - ./overlays/dev
```

3. Run Skaffold

```bash
skaffold dev
```

4. Skaffold will monitor changes, build new images, and redeploy automatically.

## Activity for Today

1. Set up Kustomize for a sample application with different environments.
2. Automate your Kubernetes workflow with Skaffold.
3. Test live changes in your application using Skaffoldâ€™s auto-deploy feature.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore building a developer-friendly platform by integrating tools like [Backstage](https://backstage.io) for internal developer portals.
