Welcome to Day 4 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! Now that weâ€™ve covered the basics of Kubernetes, itâ€™s time to explore one of its most powerful features: Deployments and Scaling. These tools let you manage your applications efficiently, ensuring theyâ€™re always running and able to handle demand.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn Today

By the end of this post, you'll be able to:

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment.
2. Scale your application up and down.
3. Perform a rolling update to deploy a new version.
4. Roll back if something goes wrong.

Let's get started! ðŸš€

### Step 1: Create Your First Deployment

1. Create a file called deployment.yaml with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: zero-to-platform-eng
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: zero-to-platform-eng
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: zero-to-platform-eng
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

2. Apply the Deployment to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

3. Check if your Pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

ðŸŽ¯ What's happening?

_Kubernetes creates 2 replicas of your application (as defined in replicas: 2), ensuring your app is always available._

### Step 2: Scale Your Deployment

1. Scale the Deployment up to 5 replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment zero-to-platform-eng --replicas=5
```

2. Verify the new number of Pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

ðŸŽ¯ Pro tip:
_Scaling down works the same way:_

```bash
kubectl scale deployment zero-to-platform-eng --replicas=1
```

### Step 3: Perform a Rolling Update

1. Update your application to use a new image version:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/zero-to-platform-eng nginx=nginx:1.21.0
```

2. Check the rollout status:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/zero-to-platform-eng
```

ðŸŽ¯ What's happening?

\*Kubernetes performs a rolling update, gradually replacing old Pods with new ones to avoid downtime.

3. Confirm the new Pods are running the updated version:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### Roll Back a Deployment

1. If something goes wrong, undo the update:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/zero-to-platform-eng
```

2. Verify that the Deployment has reverted to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/zero-to-platform-eng
```

ðŸŽ¯ Pro tip:
_You can see the revision history of your Deployment with:_

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/zero-to-platform-eng
```

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

When youâ€™re done experimenting, delete the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment zero-to-platform-eng
```

## Activity for Today

Here's your challenge for Day 4:

1. Create a Deployment using the steps above.
2. Scale it up and down and observe how Kubernetes manages the Pods.
3. Perform a rolling update with a new image and roll it back if needed.
4. Bonus: Try changing the replicas value directly in deployment.yaml and applying it again.

## What's Next?

You've now mastered the basics of Deployments and scaling! ðŸŽ‰ Tomorrow, we'll dive into Kubernetes Services, which enable communication between your Pods and the outside world.
