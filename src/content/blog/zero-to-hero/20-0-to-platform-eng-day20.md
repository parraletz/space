Welcome to Day 20 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re doing a recap of observability best practices and assembling a basic observability stack using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry.

## What Is an Observability Stack?

An observability stack consists of tools that help monitor, log, and trace applications to ensure performance and reliability.

### Key Components of Observability:

- Metrics â†’ Measure system health (CPU, memory, request rates).
- Logs â†’ Capture detailed event information for debugging.
- Traces â†’ Provide insights into request flows across services.

### A full observability stack includes:

- Prometheus â†’ Metrics collection
- Grafana â†’ Visualization and dashboards
- Loki â†’ Centralized logging
- OpenTelemetry â†’ Distributed tracing

## Building a Cloud-Native Observability Stack

### Metrics and Prometheus

- Collects time-series data from kubernetes, applications, and infrastructure.
- Uses PromQL to query and aggregate data.

#### 1. Install Prometheus with Helm:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

#### 2. Example PromQL Queries:

```promql
sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) by (pod)
```

### Dashboards and Grafana

- Provides a graphical interface for creating and managing dashboards.
- Allows you to visualize metrics and logs.
- Integrates with Prometheus and Loki.
- Supports alerting for proactive monitoring.

#### Install Grafana with Helm:

```bash
helm install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring
```

#### Import a Pre-Built Dashboard:

1. Go to Dashboards > Import.
2. Enter Dashboard ID: 9135 (Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring)
3. Select Prometheus as the data source
4. Click Import to visualize your cluster metrics
5. Click Save to store your dashboard

### Logs with Loki

- Lightweight, scalable, and highly-available logging solution.
- Works seamlessly with grafana for log analysis.

#### Install Loki with Helm:

```bash
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack --namespace monitoring
```

#### Query logs in Grafana:

```logql
{job="nginx"} |= "error"
```

### Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry

- Captures end-to-end request flows across microservices.
- Helps debug latency issues and optimize performance.

#### Install OpenTelemetry with Helm:

```bash
helm install otel-collector open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector --namespace monitoring
```

## Why Use an Observability Stack?

- Faster troubleshooting and debugging. Quickly identify issues and root causes.
- Better Performance Monitoring. Identify bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization.
- Improved incident response. Reduce downtime and improve customer satisfaction.

## Activity for Today

1. Review metrics, logs, and traces and how they work together.
2. Install Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry.
3. Test queries, dashboards, and alerts in Grafana.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll shift focus to Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and discuss how platform teams improve developer experience.
