Welcome to Day 16 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™ll explore Prometheus, the go-to tool for monitoring Kubernetes and collecting real-time metrics.



## Why Monitoring with Prometheus?

### Monitoring is essential to:

* Detect Issues Early: Identify problems before they impact users.
* Optimize Performance: Track CPU, memory, and request latencies.
* Enable Alerting: Automatically notify teams when issues arise.

### ðŸŽ¯ What Prometheus Provides:

* Time-series database optimized for Kubernetes metrics.
* Powerful query language (PromQL) for analyzing data.
* Built-in alerting and integrations with Grafana, Alertmanager, and more.

## Installing Prometheus in Kubernetes

### Step 1: Deploy Prometheus with Helm

1. Add the Prometheus Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

2. Deploy Prometheus with Helm:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace

```

3. Verify that Prometheus is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

### Step 2: Accessing Prometheus UI

1. Forward Prometheus to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090
```

2. Open Prometheus UI in your browser:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:9090
```

### Step 3: Querying Metrics with PromQL

Run the following PromQL queries to analyze metrics:

1. CPU usage of all nodes:

```promql
sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (instance)
```

2. Memory usage of all nodes:

```promql
sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (pod)
```

3. Requests per second to your application:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[1m])
```




##  Activity for Today

1.  Deploy Prometheus using Helm.
2.  Run PromQL queries to analyze your clusterâ€™s metrics.
3.  Configure Alertmanager to notify when CPU usage is high.


## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll visualize Prometheus metrics with Grafana, creating custom dashboards and alerts.
