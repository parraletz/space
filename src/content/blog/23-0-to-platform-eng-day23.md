Welcome to Day 23 of the Zero to Platform Engineer in 30 Days challenge! ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™re focusing on secrets management using HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager, two powerful tools for securing credentials, API keys, and sensitive data.



## Why Secrets Management Matters

Handling secrets securely is critical to:

* Prevent credential leaks and unauthorized access.
* Automate secrets rotation for improved security.
* Enable role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive data.

ðŸ’¡ Secrets should never be stored in Git repositories or hardcoded in applications!

## Secrets Management Tools: HashiCorp Vault vs. AWS Secrets Manager

|Feature| HashiCorp Vault  | AWS Secrets Manager |
|--|--|--|
| Type | OpenSource & Enterprise | Managed AWS Services|
| Use Case | Self-Hosted secrets management | Cloud-native AWS Integration |
| Auto-Rotation | Yes, vÃ­a polices | With AWS Lambda Integration|
| Encription| AES-256 | AWS KMS |
| Access Control | RBAC, polices and tokens | AWS IAM roles & policies |


ðŸ“Œ Both tools provide encryption, access control, and auto-rotation, but HashiCorp Vault offers more flexibility for multi-cloud environments.

## How HashiCorp Vault Works

* Stores secrets securely in a central location.
* Generates dynamic credentials for databases, APIs, and cloud providers.
* Supports Kubernetes integration for injecting secrets into pods.

### Installing HashiCorp Vault (Helm in Kubernetes):
   
```bash
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
helm repo update
helm install vault hashicorp/vault --namespace vault --create-namespace

```

### Storing a secret in Vault:


```bash
vault kv put secret/my-app password="supersecure123"
```

### Retrieving a secret:

```bash
vault kv get secret/my-app
```

1. Open Backstage in your browser: http://localhost:3000

## How AWS Secrets Manager Works

* Securely stores AWS credentials, API keys, and database passwords.
* Integrates with AWS Lambda for automatic secret rotation.
* Uses AWS IAM for access control and permissions.

###  Creating a secret in AWS Secrets Manager:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name my-secret --secret-string '{"username":"admin","password":"supersecure123"}'
```

### Retrieving a secret:

```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id my-secret
```

ðŸ“Œ AWS Secrets Manager is ideal for cloud-native AWS applications needing seamless IAM integration.

## Best Practices for Secrets Management


* Never hardcode secrets in application code.
* Use short-lived, dynamically generated credentials.
* Restrict access to secrets using RBAC and least privilege.
* Enable automatic rotation for database credentials and API keys.
* Monitor and audit secret access logs for anomalies.

## Activity for Today


1. Set up HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Store a secret and retrieve it using CLI commands.
3. Explore auto-rotation features for credentials.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll scale Kubernetes applications using HPA and Cluster Autoscaler.
